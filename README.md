### **INFO**

Python Script to help/automate the WiFi hacking exercises.

No extra installs needed, the ones needed can be installed inside the tool.

This tool was developed to automate the process of conducting a PenTest on WiFi Networks with Aircrack-ng in Python.

### **KEY POINTS**
* It can detect when a handshake is achieved and stop the monitoring and deauth commands.
* Stores by date all MAC addresses, SSID and WiFi Password on a file.
* You can use any wordlist you want, and you can add any word to any wordlist you want inside the tool.
* Uses multiprocessing, therefore it is fast and reliable.
* **IT IS OPENSOURCE!**

### **INSTRUCTIONS**

For this tool to work in the best possible way please follow these instructions:

  	•	Execute Option 2 in the Main Menu.
	
  	•	Try to use the tool functionalities, preferably don't clean files manually.

### **DISCLAIMERS**

  	•	This tool was tested/created in a fully updated Kali Linux Machine (v2020.3).
	
  	•	Aircrack-ng need to be installed (Option 1 in Main Menu).
	
  	•	WiFi Card used to run in monitor mode was an ALFA AWUS036NHA.
	
  	•	This tool uses rockyou.txt wordlist to do the cracking by default, but you can use your own. (Keep in mind that you need to use the .txt file and not the .txt.tar.gz file, "gunzip rockyou.txt.tar.gz" to get the .txt wordlist).
	
  	•	This tool is for educational purposes only.

### **TO DO LIST**
* Migrate entire tool to Python 3. (DONE in v1.1)
* Add dynamic tables (Maybe PrettyTable Library).
* Create an option for full automation (Monitor, Get 4WHS, Decrypt) in one go.
* Add more than 1 word per entry to wordlist.
* Many more to come...
